Title and Hook:
  "Not the Neighbor You Want" - cute, but this isn't a BuzzFeed article. You're trying too
   hard to be clever when you should be direct. The opening paragraph is serviceable but
  you immediately undercut your own findings by saying geography "was not a meaningful
  transmission mechanism." Way to kill any suspense.

  Methods Section:
  Your variable description reads like you copied it from a stats textbook. "Log was taken
   to normalize the banking sectors" - just say you used logs for heteroskedasticity, we
  all know why. The equation formatting is fine, but your treatment group definition is
  hilariously arbitrary. Nine western states? Why not eight? Why not ten? Nevada as an
  "outlier" - convenient excuse to drop inconvenient data.

  The Differential Plot:
  This is actually not terrible, but your interpretation is weak sauce. "A couple dots in
  particular are notable" - pick a lane. Either analyze all the outliers systematically or
   don't cherry-pick three states and call it analysis. Delaware "did well" is not
  economic insight.

  Results Section - The Real Problem:
  You found a 6.2% effect, then immediately spent the rest of the section explaining why
  it doesn't mean what you thought it meant. This is either intellectual honesty or you
  didn't think through your hypothesis before running the regression. "We reject the
  hypothesis" - at least you're honest about finding nothing, but this whole exercise
  feels like you started with a conclusion and worked backwards.

  What You Actually Found:
  Regional banking differences exist. Shocking. Interest rates affect different regions
  differently. Revolutionary. Your diff-in-diff captured pre-existing trends, not causal
  effects. This is Econometrics 101 - you need parallel trends, and you clearly don't have
   them.

  The Real Issue:
  This reads like you thought you'd find dramatic spillover effects, ran the numbers,
  found nothing interesting, but had to write something anyway. The analysis is competent
  but the framing is all wrong. You should have led with "we test whether geographic
  proximity matters for bank contagion and find it doesn't" instead of trying to build
  suspense around a null result.
