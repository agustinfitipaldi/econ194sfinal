# The Big Idea

Compare how the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (& Co?) affected a variety of bank measures using a difference in difference design with California as the treated group and the rest of the 50 states as the untreated group.

- Core Deposits to Total Liabilities - CA vs Rest (minus NV?)
 
- Earning Assets - CA vs Rest (add NY for robustness?)

- Equity Capital - CA vs Rest (looks very similar to EA)

- Gross 1-4 Family Mortgages to Gross Assets - CA vs Rest

- Return on Assets - CA vs Rest (there are other movers 2023Q1, add in for robust)
    - Assets Less than 1bn has a lagged response?

- Return on Equity - CA vs Rest (there are other movers...)
    - Same deal as for ROA

- Total Assets - CA vs Rest

- Total Deposits - CA vs Rest

- Total Loans & Leases - CA vs Rest
    - Isn't this a rehashing of Total Assets? What's kept out?


# Notes

- Should we/can we add fixed effects for state and time?

- Problem Bank List, highly confidential, contains banks FDIC and co are worried about, comes from CAMELS rating, only number of banks on list and fluctuations quarter to quarter are reported

- [CAMELS rating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAMELS_rating_system), also highly confidential, grades banks on Capital adequacy, Assets, Management Capability, Earnings, Liquidity, and Sensitivity.

## Event Overview

### SVB Overview

1. SVB had purchased a lot of long term treasury bonds

2. To curb inflation there were rate hikes by the fed which decreased the market value of the bonds, leading to significant unrealized losses

3. Rate hikes meant some clients were withdrawing funds to meet liquidity needs

4. With losses and funds being withdrawn SVB started drifting into danger territory (not enough assets to cover liabilities), and word started spreading

5. Social media amongst other things cause lots of individuals to withdraw their money, incurring 42bn in withdrawals on March 9th

6. On March 10th CDFPI seized the bank and put it under the receivership of FDIC

### First Republic

1. In a similar situation to SVB with a high percentage of uninsured deposits, mainly from NY

2. After the March Crisis, Fitch and S&P downgraded FR's credit rating citing these concerns

3. A bunch of banks (JPM, BofA, WF, CITI, and Truist) deposited ~30bn to alleviate concerns

4. Was not enough, and the assets that the bank mainly held were not eligible for some special lending program which had helped SVB

5. On April 28th they began selling assets in order to raise equity, started firing people too.

6. FDIC showed interest in taking over the bank causing stock price to plummet

7. FDIC finally seized FR in after hours trading on the 28th and sold it to JPM on May 1st
