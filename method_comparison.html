<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>Based on the Model 4 results (with both state and quarter fixed effects), we can evaluate:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Statistical Significance</strong>: Which methods show robust effects even with proper controls</li>
<li><strong>Pre-trend Quality</strong>: Which methods have similar pre-treatment trends</li>
<li><strong>Economic Magnitude</strong>: Size of the estimated effects</li>
</ol>
<p>The most credible results come from methods that show: - Significant effects in Model 4 - Small pre-trend differences - Economically meaningful coefficient sizes</p>
