**On March 10, 2023,** Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was rendered insolvent and closed by federal regulators, marking the second biggest bank collapse in history second to only Washington Mutual in 2008. SVB was unique among midsize banks as it was responsible for almost half of all venture capital and start-ups around the world. This study examines whether the SVB collapse had regional spillover effects, ultimately finding that geography was not a meaningful transmission mechanism.

We collected data from FDIC State Tables and formatted it into panel style grouped by state and quarters between 2019 and 2024. Our final variables of interest were state, quarter, and log of "Core Deposit to Total Liabilities - All Institutions". Log was taken to normalize the banking sectors across states, as well as facilitate regression calculations. From here, we created binary variables to represent western and non-western state groupings, as well as pre and post SVB crash dates (after 2022Q4). Then, we created a final binary variable to represent observations on the west state grouping and after the crash date.

In order to analyze changes in core deposits to total liabilities, we used the following specification:

\begin{equation}
\text{CoreDeposits}_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1\text{Crash}_{it} + \gamma_i + \tau_t + \epsilon_{it}
\end{equation}

Where $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are the intercept and slope coefficient parameters respectively. $\text{Crash}_{it}$ is a binary variable that is $1$ if state $i$ is in our treatment group after the Silicon Valley Bank crash. $\gamma_i$ represents state fixed effects and $\tau_t$ stands for time fixed effects.

To test whether geographic proximity served as a transmission mechanism we form a western treatment group consisting of nine states: Oregon, Arizona, Washington, Idaho, Utah, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico; and compare against a control group of the rest of the states. Nevada was excluded from the data as an outlier.

In order to analyze the effect space for the crash, it will be helpful to look at a differential graph and plot our state data onto it. In @fig-differential you'll see each dot representing both that state's average rate of change *before* the crash, in it horizontal coordinate, and its average rate of change *after* the crash, in its vertical coordinate.

This allows us to see the group's diversity in reception of the effect, or rather the lack of diversity. The plot shows clustering around similar post-crash levels, suggesting that the crash itself wasn't the primary driver of deposit changes. A couple dots in particular are notable to point out: the dot in the top right is Delaware, indicating that it did well before and after the crash; California's dot shows up under the orange triangle, that is, it was affected an average amount; finally, the dot in the bottom left is Arizona.

## Results

Using a difference-in-differences approach with state and time fixed effects, we find a statistically significant 6.2% decrease in core deposits to total liabilities in western states compared to non-western states following the SVB collapse. However, robustness checks reveal this result is not driven by SVB-specific regional contagion. The effect persists when removing California (the state most directly connected to SVB) and remains significant even when excluding Arizona.

The differential plot helps clarify: western states were already on different trajectories before the SVB collapse, suggesting the observed 'treatment effect' reflects pre-existing regional differences rather than spillover from the bank failure itself. This pattern is consistent with broader macroeconomic pressures, particularly the 2022 interest rate increases, affecting regional banking markets differently. We reject the hypothesis of SVB-driven regional contagion, though regional differences in deposit flows were evident during this period.
