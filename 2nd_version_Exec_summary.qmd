**On March 10, 2023,** Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was rendered insolvent and closed by federal regulators, marking the second biggest bank collapse in history second to only Washington Mutual in 2008. SVB was unique among midsize banks as it was responsible for almost half of all venture capital and start-ups around the world (Grossman, 2024). In today's globalized economy, bank runs can have effects all over the planet, but it may be possible that areas in geographical proximity experience heightened effects. The study "Not the Neighbor You Want: Regional Contagion from Silicon Valley Bank Collapse" analyzes regional contagion from bank collapses on first order effects in the form of core deposits to total liabilities.

In order to analyze regional changes in core deposits to total liabilities we first had to collect data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). This data was formatted into panel style grouped by state and business quarters between 2019 and 2025. Our final variables of interest were state, date/quarter, and log core deposit to total liabilities for all institutions since this would make banking sectors more comparable across different size state bank sectors. From here, binary variables were created to represent western and non-western state groupings, as well as pre and post SVB crash dates (after 2022 quarter 4). Then, a final binary variable was created to represent observations on the west state grouping and after the crash date.

In order to analyze changes in core deposits to total liabilities, the following specification was used:

$$
\text{CoreDeposits}_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1\text{Crash}_{it} + \gamma_i + \tau_t + \epsilon_{it}
$$

Where $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are the intercept and slope coefficient parameters respectively. $\text{Crash}_{it}$ is a binary variable that is $1$ if state $i$ is in our treatment group after the Silicon Valley Bank crash. $\gamma_i$ represents state fixed effects and $\tau_t$ stands for time fixed effects.

Our western state treatment group consists of nine states: Oregon, Arizona, Washington, Idaho, Utah, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico. Nevada was excluded due to an unrelated crash in core deposits from mid-2022 rate increases, and California was excluded since SVB was located there and we wanted to examine spillover effects to neighboring states.

## Results

In order to analyze the effect space for the crash, it will be helpful to look at a differential space and plot our state data onto it. In @fig-differential you'll see each each dot representing both that state's average rate of change *before* the crash, in it horizontal coordinate, and its average rate of change *after* the crash, in its vertical coordinate.

This allows us to see groups diversity in reception of the effect, or rather the lack of diversity. For a typical difference in difference we would want to see a graph that was stretched in the vertical direction, this would indicate disparate effects for different states. But our picture is stretched in the opposite way, we see that predominately we had states behaving differently *before* the crash but all mostly clumped along the same y-region *after*. A couple dots in particular are notable to point out: the dot in the top right is Delaware, indicating that it did well before and after the crash; California's dot shows up under the orange triangle, that is it was affected an average amount; finally, the dot in the bottom left is Arizona.

Using a difference-in-differences approach with state and time fixed effects, we find a statistically significant 6.2% decrease in core deposits to total liabilities in western states compared to eastern states following the SVB collapse. However, after robustness checks we found the same effect, in fact a few points higher when California was removed from the group. The reason for this should be evident after seeing the differential graph, Arizona is the state dragging the group down.
